# Final Presentation

You may do it live, or you may do it pre-recorded via Video (uploaded to YouTube or Vimeo, or any other video sharing service.).

Here's a tutorial [video on making demo videos from CS48 S20](https://youtu.be/k0Je8ASh4jo) (Video inception)

Based on the experience of CS48 students, **pre-recording is strongly recommended**.  You will *know for sure* in advance whether the
demo is successful, and whether or not you've hit the target length of 5-10 minutes.

Your video should be 5 to 10 minutes long, and cover these points:

* First, mention the names of the members of the team, and introduce the person narrating the video.  
  - It is ok if all the team members appear in the video.  It is also ok if only one person narrates the video on behalf of the team.
* Second, go through each of the features that your team worked on that were merged into `main`
  - Only demo the features that were merged into `main`
  - Focus in this part of the video on demoing the features from a *user perspective*, not on the technical details of how they were implemented.
* Next, if there is time remaining to reach the 5-10 minute mark, you may briefly cover any technical and/or non-technical challenges your team faced
  - You don't have to cover everything.  
  - You don't really even have to include this part if your demo already hits the 5-10 minute range.
  - If you do include this part, focus on the items that you think would be interesting to the audience (fellow students in CS156 F20, and the staff of CS156 F20). 
  - Possible items to include
    - Particularly interesting technical details of what you had to write in the code
    - Challenges in testing
    - Challenges in team communication and organization, and what you did to overcome those
* Optional: at the end, if you like, you may thank anyone that was particularly helpful to the team from the staff (TAs and LAs, or students from other teams). 
  - Please don't include thanks to me (Prof. Conrad) in the video; I don't want this to be an exercise in brown-nosing.
  - If you do want to express gratitude, feel free to share your thoughts with me on the Slack, by email, etc.  

Please then also poll your team members and let me know your thoughts about the privacy of your final demo video:
* public, available to anyone that is interested in the app and the course
* unlisted, but ok to make it available to future CMPSC 156 students (as an example, and to orient them to the app)
* unlisted, and only shown once for this team's final demo, and to course staff

# Final Presentation Participation Assignment

(This will count as a participation assignment in your final course grade.)

* You'll be asked to critique each team's presentation, including your own.
  - Write down what you liked, and what could have been improved.
* You'll then be asked to put the presentations in one of three groups: top, middle, bottom.  
  - Give a brief justification (one sentence is enough)
* Each group must have either three or four presentations in it (total of 10).

* You are invited to consider these factors, and weigh them according to your own sense of how important they are:
  - Clarity of presentation: did you understand what the speakers were saying?
  - Impact on the application: how much did the team accomplish in terms of improving the application?
  - Presentation Style: Was the presentation enjoyable to listen to?
  - Working as a team: Did you have a sense from the presentation that the team worked well together and supported one another?

# Final CATME.org survey

This will be opened immediately after the final course presentations, and will be open for 48 hours.
