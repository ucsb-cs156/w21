List of Team Assignments: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s21/info/teams/>

Yesterday in lecture:
* You got to know your teammates
* You discussed some of the thing that help to make good teams.   

# Today's Team Activity

This activity works with the paper that you were assigned to read during lecture yesterday.

You do not need to have read the whole thing for today, but you need to have at least skimmed it.

Here's the link: <https://pconrad.github.io/files/paper028.pdf>.  

* The title of this paper is *Listening to Early Career Developers* 
* I'll call this paper **LTD** for short (i.e. **L**istening **T**o **D**evelopers)

Our focus will be Section 4, which is divided into 6 sections:

| Section | Title | Academia | Industry | 
|---------|-------|----------|----------|
| 4.1 | What: Differences in Scope | well-defined, fixed scope | vague, open-ended, evolving scope |
| 4.2 | When: Short vs. Long Time Spans | short time spans (days, weeks)  | long time spans (months, years) |
| 4.3 | Who: Individual vs. Large Team | individuals, pairs, small groups  | larger teams |
| 4.4 | Why: Learning vs. User Needs | to learn something  | to address a user need |
| 4.5 | How: Ad-Hoc vs. Professional | ad-hoc tools and practices |  professional tools and formal practices |
| 4.6 | How Big: Small vs. Large Codebases | small programs | large complex systems |

You'll first assign one person from your team to each section; most teams have six people, so that's team member per section.

You might use the team slack channel, and use first-come, first-served, or some other way to divide up the sections.

If you have fewer than six team members, you can decide to leave one section uncovered.  (If one or more team members is absent,
put a slack message in your team channel mentioning them by `@`-ing them, and letting them know which section(s) are left
to be claimed.)

Then, you'll elect one member of the team as the team scribe (a different one from last time) that can share their screen.

That member of the team should go to the repo for your team on GitHub.  Here are links to these repos:

| 5pm | 6pm | 7pm |

That should currently be an empty, private repo, accessible only to the course staff and the members of your team.   The scribe, when they bring up the repo,
will see something like the image shown below.  Click on the README link to create a README.md file:

![click to create README](click-to-create-README-50.png)

Then, your screen will look something like the image below:  
* You will see a text area where you can enter text for the README.md file for this repo.
* There are tabs to toggle between Edit and Preview; the format is Markdown, which is explained on [This Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf)
* You may have to scroll down to find the "Commit New File" button, which is how you save your changes.


![new README](new-README-50.png)

What content should you type?  Type a list of who is assigned to each section, something like this (you can copy/paste this, then edit it for your group)

The heading should look like this: <tt># Notes from {{ page.class_date }}</tt>

```
# Notes from (date)

Paper Section Assignments:

* 4.1: Alice Z.
* 4.2: Bob Y.
* 4.3: Chris X.
* 4.4: (unassigned)
* 4.5: Danny W.
* 4.6: Emily V.
```

Then, save the file.   This first part is worth 20% towards your group participation grade; each person assigned to a section earns this if/when this 
gets committed to GitHub.

# Each person now creates a file for their section

Next, each member of the team (individually) should create a file pertaining to their own section.  You can do this by following the instructions/images below.

Note: Please follow the naming conventions shown below STRICTLY, including upper vs. lower-case letters.  


First, find the "Create New File" button:

![Create-new-file-50.png](Create-new-file-50.png)

Then, start typing the folder name <tt>{{page.class_date}}</tt>, as shown (in the image, it says 01/05, but use the date given in the instructions).  
As soon as you type the forward slash `/`, you should see that the filename turns into a folder name.  
If you have made a typo, you can hit the delete/backspace key, and it should go back so you can edit the folder name.

![start-typing-folder-50.png](start-typing-folder-50.png)

![after-typing-folder-50.png](after-typing-folder-50.png)

Finally, name your file as shown in the example, and fill in content as shown in the example.  For now, we *only* need the heading; the content can come later.
The folder name should be <tt>{{page.class_date}}</tt> and the file name should be one of these: `sect4.1.md`, `sect4.2.md`, `sect4.3.md`, `sect4.4.md`, `sect4.5.md`, `sect4.6.md`. 

![fill-in-section-heading-50.png](fill-in-section-heading-50.png)

You earn 50 points towards the individual part of today's participation when you create your individual part of the repo. You only need the heading; no content yet, that's for Monday.

# H01

This is your homework H01 for Monday; you don't necessarily need to do it right now.  Just read over it and make sure you understand it.

Between now and Monday, read over the part of the paper that you were assigned, and think about these questions, and write something in your .md file
for each of these questions. This will count as an individual homework grade, H01, due Monday.

1. (40 pts) For the aspect of software development that you were assigned, the paper describes some aspects of what software development in school is like, vs.
   what it is like in industry.  

   Now consider your own personal experiences in school.  Do they line up with what was reported in the paper, or are they different?  Is it a mix?
   
   In your <tt>{{page.class_date}}/sect4.<i>x</i>.md</tt> file (where <tt><i>x</i></tt> is one of 1,2,3,4,5 or 6), 
   write briefly about your own personal experiences in school that are relevant to this topic, and how they are the same or different
 (or a mix of both), as compared to what the interview subjects in the paper reported.  Put this under the heading `# Question 1`.  
 
2. (30 pts) Under the heading `# Question 2`, answer this question: What are the things that developers found suprising or different about industry in terms of
   this aspect of software development?   
   
3. (30 pts) Under the heading `# Question 3`, answer this question: What are suggestions for things students could do in school to better prepare them for
   this aspect of software development as practiced in industry?  
   
   These can be ideas from the paper, or ideas of your own; either is fine.  But in your answer, clearly identify whether each idea is your idea,
   or one from the paper.
   

# What happens after Monday?

On Monday, we'll ask each of you to read the answers of your teammates.  Then Wednesday, be prepared for a full discussion of the paper.  There will be more questions to answer then.

# Checklist for today's work

1. Double check that someone on the team has set the `README.md` of your team's <tt>{{site.qxx}}-xpm-y-NOTES</tt> repo to have the correct content (list of who is assigned to which section, with a heading of<tt># Notes from {{ page.class_date }}</tt>

2. Double check that each member of the team that's present has create a file in that repo under a folder called <tt><{{page.class_date}}/tt> with the correct content (a file that's one of (`sect4.1.md1`, `sect4.2.md`, etc.) and that the content of that file matches the instructions above.  It only needs to be a header at this point.

# What then?  

Several options:

* Watch a 20 minute video about VS Code and the Sohibe Code Generators (now or sometime between now and next week.)
* Ask for help with jpa00 or jpa01
* Ask staff questions about the course
* Get started on H01

# A 20 minute video on VS Code

Here's a 20 video about using VSCode and some of the cool things you can do with it, including the use of the Sohibe code generators for automatically generating getters/setters and other "boilerplate" code for plain old Java classes.  

If you watch it and understand how it works, it can save you a *lot* of time when writing Java classes.
